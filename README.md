# Sand Simulation
Welcome to your first graphics + simulation task!

In this task, youâ€™ll be creating a sand falling simulator using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). This is a great opportunity to improve your skills by combining physics simulation with real-time graphics rendering, and learn modern C++ programming.

You'll simulate sand particles under the power of gravity, which collide with one another and settle into patterns that look like nature. The user must be able to create/remove sand particles by using mouse. You can use one key for removal and another for addition of sand. The particles must act naturallyâ€”falling, piling, and slidingâ€”like sand in real life. By the end of this project, youâ€™ll have created a fully functional visual simulation of classic sandbox games. You'll also gain a solid understanding of C++ programming, real-time simulations, and graphics development.

## What you will learn
- Basics of Modern C++ programming
- Using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML)
- Basics of graphics and simulation logics

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Learn the basics of C++ including arrays and vectors
- Understanding the usages of each SFML methods used.
- The user should have the choice to add or remove sand at pointer location.

## ðŸ›  Getting Started
1. To begin create a repository in you Github account and clone it.
2. Install the following packages
- g++ (For compiling and linking)
- SFML (For rendering)

For Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
```
For any other distros, refer to [SFML Download guide](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/3.0.0/)

3. Create a file named main.cpp and paste the example code
``` C++
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

int main()
{
    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode({200, 200}), "SFML works!");
    sf::CircleShape shape(100.f);
    shape.setFillColor(sf::Color::Green);

    while (window.isOpen())
    {
        while (const std::optional event = window.pollEvent())
        {
            if (event->is<sf::Event::Closed>())
                window.close();
        }

        window.clear();
        window.draw(shape);
        window.display();
    }
}
```
4. Compile the code and link to sfml library using g++
```
g++ -c main.cpp
```
5. To link the SFML library
```
g++ main.cpp -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```
6. Now simply run `./sfml-app` from terminal.

## âœ… Submission Guidelines
The repository must have:
- main.cpp where your code is written
- The steps to compile the library if any other libraries are used given in the README.
- Include simple steps taken to make this simulation in the README.

<b>Happy Coding!</b>
